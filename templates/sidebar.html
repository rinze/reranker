<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p>This is an expansion over my previous <a href="https://github.com/rinze/rank-es"><em>rank-es</em></a> project: how to create a news aggregator with very little code, letting Twitter and Facebook do the news ranking for you. In this new version, Disqus provides the commenting system. You can find more information on this on <a href="https://github.com/rinze/reranker">its github page</a> and on <a href="http://rinzewind.org/blog-en/2015/reranker.html">this blog post</a>.</p>
